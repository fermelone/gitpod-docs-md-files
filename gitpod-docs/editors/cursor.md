# Cursor

[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) uses the same extension as VS Code. Most of [VS Code documentation](/flex/editors/vscode) is applicable to Cursor. When reaching out to support, please specify that you are using Cursor as your editor.

## Opening an Environment

You can select Cursor from the editor selector dropdown by clicking on the dropdown arrow next to the editor button on the action bar.
