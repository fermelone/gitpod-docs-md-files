# View members

As a regular member of an organization, you can view other members in the Settings. However, you cannot change anyone's membership. You do have the option to leave the organization via the drop-down menu.

If you choose to leave the organization, another one of your organizations will be selected automatically, or youâ€™ll be prompted to create a new one.
