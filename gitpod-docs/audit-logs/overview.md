# Audit Logs

Audit logs provide a record of all actions taken in a Gitpod organization. Using the audit logs, you can track who performed an operation, on which resource, and when. Gitpod produces audit logs for all operations within an organization.

## Accessing Audit Logs

Audit logs are accessible to users with the **Organization Owner** role. You can retrieve audit logs using the **Gitpod CLI** or the **Gitpod API**.

### Using the CLI

You can view audit logs using the `gitpod` CLI, which is pre-installed on all Gitpod environments.

```bash
gitpod audit-logs [--limit=number_of_entries]
```

For additional options, including filtering and output formatting (JSON or YAML), run:

```bash
gitpod audit-logs --help
```

#### Example Output

```bash
âžœ gitpod audit-logs
