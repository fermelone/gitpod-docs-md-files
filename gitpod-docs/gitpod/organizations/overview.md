# Overview

> Organizations represent groups you can join within an account. They let users share resources like remote runners and projects to collaborate easily.

Organizations give administrators control and insight into resources. Administrators can manage shared projects and environments, as well as create shared runners to be used by all members.

Organizations help teams collaborate effectively by providing a shared space for development resources and controls. They represent distinct groups within your account, each with their own isolated set of resources and permissions.

For personal use, you can create an Organization for yourself.

## Key Benefits

* Resource Sharing: Share runners, projects and secrets across your team
* Access Control: Manage who can access what through role-based permissions
* Standardization: Create organization-wide projects
* Cost Management: Track and control of resource usage in your Organization

## Organization Resources

Organizations act as containers for:

* Projects: Standardized development environment configurations
* Runners: Self-hosted infrastructure for running environments
* Members: Users with varying levels of access and permissions
* Settings: Organization-wide configurations and policies

## Isolation

Organizations represent hard boundaries - resources cannot be shared or transferred between organizations. Organizations are isolated from each other through strong access controls.

Each organizational resource belongs to exactly one organization - runners, projects and environments. Users can be members of multiple organizations but must switch between them explicitly
