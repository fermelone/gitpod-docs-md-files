# Create or join an organization

If you're signing in for the first time, Gitpod will prompt you to create a new organization, where you'll automatically be the *admin*.

## Create a new organization

When creating a new organization, you need to specify its name. You can change the name later in the Settings.

Select the option 'Anyone with a “*yourdomain.org*” domain can join' to allow users with the same email domain to join when they sign up.

## Join an organization

If other users have already created organizations that allow you to join, you'll see a list of them. You can select 'Join' to become a *member* of one of those organizations.

You can access the `Join or create an organization` dialog from the account drop-down menu at any time.
